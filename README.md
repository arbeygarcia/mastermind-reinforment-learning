# Mastermind Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
This project aims to develop a model capable of solving the classic game of Mastermind using reinforcement learning techniques. Inspired by the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan, this codebase shares similarities with the approach used to solve the classic game Pong in Chapter 06 of the book, which employs the "Deep Q-Network" (DQN) algorithm.

## Project Description
Mastermind is a popular board game that challenges players to deduce a secret code through a series of guesses and feedback. The goal of this project is to train an AI model to play Mastermind effectively, learning from its mistakes and gradually improving its performance over time.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies as outlined in the provided requirements.txt file.
Run the provided code to start training and evaluating the reinforcement learning model.
Dependencies
This project relies on several Python libraries and packages, which can be easily installed using the provided requirements.txt file. Make sure you have them installed before running the code.

## Usage
Once the project is set up and the dependencies are installed, you can use the code to:

## Train the reinforcement learning model to play Mastermind.
Evaluate the model's performance against different difficulty levels and strategies.
Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to achieve better results.
